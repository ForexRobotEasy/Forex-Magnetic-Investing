# Forex Magnetic Investing Expert Advisor

This is the code for the Forex Magnetic Investing Expert Advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This Expert Advisor is designed to analyze the market and generate trading signals based on the specified criteria. It also includes order management and risk control features.

## How it Works

The Expert Advisor uses the MQL5 language and requires the inclusion of certain libraries and the definition of specific variables. The necessary libraries are Trade.mqh, Math.mqh, and ArrayObj.mqh. The trade module is initialized using the `CTrade` class, and an array object called `positions` is created to store open positions.

The Expert Advisor has three main functions: `OnInit()`, `OnDeinit()`, and `OnTick()`. 

### Initialization Function (`OnInit()`)

In the `OnInit()` function, the trade module is initialized by setting a unique magic number for the expert advisor using the `SetExpertMagicNumber()` function.

### Deinitialization Function (`OnDeinit()`)

In the `OnDeinit()` function, all open positions are closed before the expert advisor is deinitialized. This is achieved by iterating through the `positions` array and using the `PositionClose()` function from the trade module to close each position.

### Start Function (`OnTick()`)

In the `OnTick()` function, the market is analyzed and trading signals are generated. The entry signal logic is implemented using a placeholder variable called `entrySignal`. This variable should be replaced with the actual signal generation logic based on your market analysis code. If the `entrySignal` is true, a market order is placed using the `PositionOpen()` function from the trade module. The opened position is then inserted into the `positions` array.

Next, the order management and risk control section is executed. It iterates through the `positions` array to update the stop-loss and take-profit levels for each open position using the `PositionModify()` function from the trade module. The stop-loss and take-profit levels are calculated based on risk management parameters.

Finally, the exit signal logic is implemented using a placeholder variable called `exitSignal`. This variable should be replaced with the actual exit signal logic. If the `exitSignal` is true, the position is closed using the `PositionClose()` function from the trade module, and it is removed from the `positions` array.
